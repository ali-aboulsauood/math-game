Original Specifications
=======================

(Fulfilled)

The following are the original specifications stated in the following lecture (https://programmingadvices.com/courses/00316b1111/lectures/41461626) provided by ProgrammingAdvices (https://programmingadvices.com).

(1) Prompt the user (hereafter referred to as the 'player' to enter the number of questions to be asked before the game is concluded. This can be any positive integer.
(2) Prompt the player to select the difficulty level of the questions that are to be asked - there are three levels of difficulty and an option to allow the questions to vary between these three levels:
	  (1) Easy: The operands are in the range from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
	  (2) Medium: The operands are in the range from 11 to 50 (inclusive)
	  (3) Hard: The operands are in the range from 51 to 100 (inclusive)
	  There is a fourth option that allows questions to vary between the three aforementioned difficulty levels.
(3) Prompt the player to select the type of arithmetic operation to be performed in the questions to be asked - the options are the four elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in addition to an option to allow the operations to vary between these four.
(4) In each question:
	  (4 - 1) Display the number of the question and the total number of questions entered by the user, separated by a forward slash ('/').
	  (4 - 2) Display the operands and the operators of the question in an appropriate, user-friendly form.
	  (4 - 3) Prompt the user to enter what they believe is the result of evaluating the operation of the question (hereafter referred to as the 'user-calculated result' or 'answer', while the true result of the same operation is referred to as the 'actual result' or 'correct answer').
	  (4 - 4) After the user enters the result of evaluating the operation. If the user-calculated result is:
			      (4 - 4 - A) equal to the actual result, change the background color of the console to green, and tell the user that their answer is correct.
			      (4 - 4 - B) not equal to the actual result, produce an alert sound, change the background color of the console to red, and tell the user that their answer is incorrect, showing the correct answer.
	(4 - 5) Repeat the previous steps under step (4) until all the questions have been answered by the user. (the total number of questions constitutes a 'quiz')
(5) After all the questions have been displayed and answered by the user, if the number of questions that the user has answered correctly is:
	  (5 - A) smaller than the number of questions he has answered incorrectly, produce an alert sound, change the background color of the console to red, and tell the user that they have failed the quiz.
	  (5 - B) greater than or equal to the number of questions he has answered incorrectly, produce a bell, change the background color of the console to green tell the user they have passed the quiz.
(6) Display the following parameters in the following order:
	  (1) The total number of questions in the quiz.
	  (2) The difficulty level of the quiz.
	  (3) The arithmetic operation(s) used in the quiz.
	  (4) The number of right answers.
	  (5) The number of wrong answers.
(7) Prompt the player to choose whether or not they wish to start a new quiz.
	  (7 - A) If the player so wishes, clear the console and reset its background color to the default.
	  (7 - B) If the player does not so wish, terminate the program.

Modifications
=============

It is intended to re-implement the project in C# for cross-platform portability.

(1) Improve the appearance of the Game Over screen.
(2) Show the percentage of correct answers in the Game Over screen.

Additional Features
===================

The following are additional features that are intended to be integrated into the project:

(1) Add a time limit to each question. 
    The time limit should be greater for greater difficulty levels.
(2) Allow the user to choose whether to save the results of the quiz and compare the results of the new quiz with those of the last one.
(3) Allow the user to access a record of their past quizzes.
(4) Allow the user to export quiz results to a text file.
